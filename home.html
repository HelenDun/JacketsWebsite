        <p>Jackets. Now you might be asking why I am starting a blog. 
            The answer is quite simple, silly human! World Domination! 
            Jackets... While my efforts to recruit minions in person has been effective, I recently did the math and realized that at the rate of recruiting one minion per week, 
            jackets, It will take me maybe 8 billion weeks. Jackets! 8 billion weeks is about 153,424,531 years! JACKETS! This is absurd!
        </p>

            Jackets. That's when I heard of the Internet. I concluded a blog would help me recruit at a much faster rate. 
            Jackets! If you have been enslaved by my absolute cuteness, press the button below to become my minion and help me dominate the world!

        <!-- Allows people to 'join' Jackets' army of cuteness -->
        <button onclick="incMinions()">Become My Minion</button>
        <!-- Displays the number of minions in Jackets' army -->
        <p>Number of Minions: <scan id="numMinions">0</scan></p>

        <!-- Link to a biography of the raccoon family -->
        <p>Jackets! This is a link to <a href="biography.html">my auto-biography</a>!</p>

        <!-- Don't sue me, please -->
        <p>Comment from the Creator: Everything here is just a silly blog for a silly stuffed animal. I don't actually want world domination. Also, Jackets says their own name repeatedly because I grew up on Pokemon.</p>
